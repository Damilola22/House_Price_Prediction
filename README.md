# House_Price_Prediction
This program uses different statistical methods to predict total basement area, house heating and basement rating using the ames housing dataset. In addition the total number of appearances of a player was also predicted using the footballer dataset.

# Data Cleaning
It involved removing variables and cases that are not useful, cleaning the variables names and changing character variables to factors.
# Linear Regression
It involved fitting different simple linear regression models to determine total basement area.
# Logistic Regression
It involved constructing a logistic regression model to determine if the house has excellent heating or not as a function of lot frontage, fireplace.
# Multinomial Regression
It involved constructing a multinomial regression model to determine the rating of the basement as a function of total basement area and remodelling year.
# Poisson Regression
It involved creating a poissoon model to predict  total number of overall appearances a player had based on position and age.
